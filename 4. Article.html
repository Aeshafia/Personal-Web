I don't really like playing Roblox alone.. well, maybe only when I'm bored because I often fall when playing parkour and that makes me annoyed... that's why I only play Roblox with my friends so we can joke around and... don't care about falling, losing or dying in the game.

I think matcha is really delicious...<br> I like matcha latte the most because it tastes delicious, the mixture of the sweet taste of matcha mixed with milk makes it taste creamy, it's really delicious for me.<br> Matcha is unique because you consume the whole ground leaf instead of just an infusion, making it a concentrated source of antioxidants and nutrients. Traditionally used by Zen monks to aid meditation, its caffeine combined with the amino acid L-theanine can promote a focused, calm energy without the crash often associated with coffee.

                        <p>my favorite anime is <a href="https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Your_Name" target="_blank">Kimi no nawa</a> we call it  "Your Name" in english.<br> it's a 2016 Japanese fantasy anime film written and directed by <a href="https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makoto_Shinkai" target="_blank">Makoto Shinkai</a> and produced by CoMix Wave Films. <br>Kimi no Na wa (Your Name) tells the story of Mitsuha, a schoolgirl in a rural village, and Taki, a student in Tokyo, who mysteriously switch bodies. As they switch bodies, they begin communicating through notes and eventually fall in love. However, Taki discovers that Mitsuha's village was destroyed three years ago by a comet, and he must fight against time and fate to save her and the village.<br> Itomori Village, one of the film's settings, is fictional. but the film draws inspiration from real locations that served as backdrops for several of its locations. These locations include <a href="https://livejapan.com/id/in-tokyo/in-pref-tokyo/in-shinjuku/article-a0000790/" target="_blank">Hida City in Gifu Prefecture</a> and the city's library.</p>
                        <p> My another favorite anime is <a href="https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Spring_Ride" target="_blank">Ao Haru Ride</a> or Blue Spring Ride who tells the story of Futaba Yoshioka, a girl trying to change her image in high school to make friends more easily, and her reunion with Kou Tanaka, her first love from middle school. Kou suddenly disappeared and now returns as a colder, more mysterious Kou, using a different surname, Kou Mabuchi. Their story then focuses on Futaba trying to understand Kou's changes and how their pasts affect their present.</p>

                            Did i tell you guys that i like a sport bike? actually..... i love watching MotoGP and riding my Yamaha R15 motobike.<br>my favorite motobike is <a href="https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ducati_Panigale_V4" target="_blank">Ducati Panigale V4S</a> 
                            because i think this motobike is very.... handsome? i like the body, sound and the machine
                            Ducati V4S motorized a Desmosedici Stradale 90° V4 with capacity 1.103 cc<br> The name "Panigale" comes from the small manufacturing town of Borgo Panigale. The Panigale V4 uses the new Desmosedici Stradale V4 engine, derived from the Desmosedici MotoGP racing engine.<br> The initial development of the Panigale V4 started with the 2015 MotoGP racing engine. Ducati said the Panigale V4 was designed to combine racing features, while also being an entertaining and rideable motorcycle with a durable engine. This created the challenge of designing an engine that could keep the MotoGP engine's counter-rotating crankshaft, and large bore diameter, but have the 24,000 km (15,000 miles) service intervals expected on consumer motorcycles. Originally, Ducati was initially keeping the MotoGP bike's chassis, but later changed to a completely new front frame they said has less weight and more stability.
